# TagBot
TagBot is a single-instance bot which runs on a Discord server and will respond to messages within a specific channel that matches the prefix

# How to configure the bot
When you have downloaded the bot, edit the "example_options.py" file to include a bot token set up from the Discord Developer Portal (https://discordapp.com/developers).
Then, get the ID of the text channel you wish for the users of a server to communicate with the bot on. This can be done through activating Developer Mode
on your Discord and right clicking the text channel and copying the ID.

When the example_options file has been populated, save the file as "options".py
